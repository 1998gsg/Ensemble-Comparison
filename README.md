# Ensemble-Comparison

The aim of this study is to determine a method for understanding ensemble models through
visual analytics. The method is used to identify and quantify the confidence levels
between the models that constitute the ensemble. This is done using an interactive
dashboard with visualizations to check the agreement and disagreement of the model's
prediction in comparison with the true class. Evaluation of the project is performed with
visualization as the core aspect of the user study. Scenarios are chosen with appropriate
questions and goals and evaluated based on the results.
